⏺ Summary of Implementation in This Session

  What Has Been Implemented

  1. UID-Based Request/Response Association System
    - Added requestId field to both ApiRequestEvent and ApiResponseEvent types in
  packages/core/src/telemetry/types.ts
    - Updated constructor signatures to include requestId parameter
  2. Updated Logging Infrastructure
    - Modified userBehaviorLogger.ts to handle requestId parameter in
  logApiRequest() and logApiResponse() methods
    - Updated loggers.ts to pass through requestId parameter
    - Updated all related tests to include requestId parameter
  3. Modified Core Chat Implementation
    - Updated geminiChat.ts to generate UUIDs using crypto.randomUUID()
    - Modified _logApiRequest() to return the generated requestId
    - Updated _logApiResponse() to accept and use requestId parameter
    - Connected request and response logging by passing requestId between them
  4. Fixed Constructor Parameter Bug
    - Identified and fixed critical bug where adding requestId to ApiResponseEvent
  constructor shifted all parameters
    - Fixed missed constructor call in openaiContentGenerator.ts that was causing:
        - "qwen-oauth" to appear as requestId (auth_type was being passed as
  requestId)
      - 0 token counts (usage_data was being passed as auth_type)
  5. Restored Token Counting
    - Fixed the parameter ordering issue that broke inputTokenCount and
  outputTokenCount
    - Verified token counts are now properly populated instead of zeros

  Current Status

  ✅ RequestId generation working with proper UUIDs
  ✅ Token counting restored and working
  ✅ No more "qwen-oauth" appearing as requestId
  ✅ Basic UID system implemented

  Outstanding TODO

  Issue: API responses still have mismatched requestIds
  - api_request shows: "requestId": "9057805f-f44b-4b4b-bd98-e23daf5d5d14"
  - api_response shows: "requestId":
  "openai-stream-847e6697-769b-463a-9031-b77b216f2ced"

  Root Cause: The system is using Qwen (which extends OpenAI generator), so
  responses are being logged through openaiContentGenerator.ts which generates its
  own requestIds instead of using the one from the request.

  TODO: Fix requestId mismatch by ensuring OpenAI-based responses use the requestId
  from the original request rather than generating new ones.
