# Enhanced Logging Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of enhanced logging features for the Qwen CLI, which captures more detailed information about API requests and responses.

## Changes Made

### 1. Extended Telemetry Types

Modified `packages/core/src/telemetry/types.ts` to include enhanced fields in `ApiRequestEvent` and `ApiResponseEvent`:

**ApiRequestEvent enhancements:**

- `operation_type`: Type of operation ('chat' | 'completion' | 'embedding' | 'tool_call' | 'unknown')
- `tools_called`: Array of tool names being requested
- `request_context`: Context of the request ('new' | 'continuation' | 'tool_result')
- `estimated_input_tokens`: Estimated tokens before sending
- `conversation_turn`: Turn number in the conversation
- `has_file_context`: Whether file context is included
- `system_prompt_length`: Length of system prompt

**ApiResponseEvent enhancements:**

- `response_type`: Type of response ('tool_call' | 'text_response' | 'mixed' | 'error' | 'streaming_chunk')
- `tool_calls`: Array of tool call information with sanitized arguments
- `content_analysis`: Analysis of response content (category, code blocks, languages, etc.)
- `quality_metrics`: Quality assessment (completeness, confidence, follow-up needs)
- `semantic_indicators`: Semantic patterns (clarifications, refusals, commands, etc.)

### 2. Updated Loggers

Modified `packages/core/src/telemetry/loggers.ts` to:

- Pass enhanced parameters to UserBehaviorLogger
- Handle complex types in log attributes by serializing them to JSON strings

### 3. Enhanced User Behavior Logger

Updated `packages/core/src/telemetry/userBehaviorLogger.ts` to:

- Extend the `UserBehaviorEvent` interface with new optional fields
- Update `logApiRequest` and `logApiResponse` methods to handle enhanced parameters

### 4. Core Implementation in GeminiChat

Enhanced `packages/core/src/core/geminiChat.ts` with helper methods for data collection:

**Helper methods added for API requests:**

- `_detectOperationType`: Determines the type of operation
- `_extractToolsCalled`: Extracts tool names from request contents
- `_determineRequestContext`: Determines request context
- `_estimateTokens`: Estimates token count
- `_hasFileContext`: Checks for file context
- `_getSystemPromptLength`: Calculates system prompt length

**Helper methods added for API responses:**

- `_detectResponseType`: Determines response type
- `_extractToolCalls`: Extracts tool call information
- `_summarizeArguments`: Creates sanitized argument summaries
- `_analyzeContent`: Analyzes response content
- `_assessQuality`: Assesses response quality
- `_detectSemanticIndicators`: Detects semantic patterns

### 5. Updated Tests

Modified `packages/core/src/telemetry/loggers.test.ts` to match the new method signatures with additional optional parameters.

## Privacy Considerations

The implementation includes several privacy protections:

- Tool arguments are sanitized and summarized rather than logged verbatim
- File paths are detected but not logged in detail
- Content analysis focuses on structural patterns rather than specific content
- All enhanced logging is backward compatible and optional

## Benefits

This enhanced logging provides valuable insights for:

- Tool usage analysis and optimization
- Performance monitoring and debugging
- Response quality assessment
- User behavior understanding
- System improvement opportunities

## Build Status

The implementation has been successfully built and tested, with only pre-existing test failures that are unrelated to our changes.
